Ideas for Web Dev project:
- Something with Spotify and music and making playlists
	- Reviewer and creator?
- Music Hub app
	- users: reviewer, (playlist) creator, artist
	- Web API: Napster? Spotify? Deezer?

Users:
- Listener
- Creator


Home:
- Following (for listeners)
- New Likes, Comments, Followers (for creators)

Search Results:
- Following section (for listeners)

Details pages:
- Playlist details
	- comments + likes
- Song details
	- comments + likes

Profile:
- Followers
- Following


Playlist/Song Cards:
- Image  -->  tracks.items.album.images[?]
- Name  -->  tracks.items.name
- Creator/Artist(s)  -->  tracks.items.artists.name
- Id?  -->  tracks.items.id


Current Next Steps:
- Followers integration
- Playlists integration
	- PlaylistDetails page
		- (Display likes and comments of playlist)
		- Remove from playlist
- Implement public Profile page
- Follows integration
- (Likes and) Comments?
- Finish all screens with new HTTP requests
	- Profile page (public + private stuff) after a user logs in
	- Home Page
	- Details Page
	- Search Page
	- Implement search of our database

Finished:
- Web API working - access token via Redux (at some point)?
- Cards displaying content --> Card grid component
- Basic unfinished Details page
- Session functionality - keep user logged in
- User type toggling (from Profile page)
- Database design
