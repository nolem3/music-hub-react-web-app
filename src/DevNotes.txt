Ideas for Web Dev project:
- Something with Spotify and music and making playlists
	- Reviewer and creator?
- Music Hub app
	- users: reviewer, (playlist) creator, artist
	- Web API: Napster? Spotify? Deezer?

Users:
- Listener
- Creator


Playlist/Song Cards:
- Image  -->  tracks.items.album.images[?]
- Name  -->  tracks.items.name
- Creator/Artist(s)  -->  tracks.items.artists.name
- Id?  -->  tracks.items.id


Finished:
- Web API working - access token via Redux (at some point)?
- Cards displaying content --> Card grid component
- Basic unfinished Details page
- Session functionality - keep user logged in
- User type toggling (from Profile page)
- Database design
- Implement public Profile page
